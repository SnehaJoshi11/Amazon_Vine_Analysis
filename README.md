Amazon_Vine_Analysis with Big Data, Spark, Postgres

## Project Overview

To Analyse Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. In this project, youâ€™ll have access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products.

## Background

**Amazon Vine**
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

Amazon Vine is an internal service of Amazon.com that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products on Amazon.[3][4][5] Companies pay a fee to Amazon and provide products for review. The products are then passed to Amazon reviewers who are then required to publish a review. Past and present participating companies include Logitech, Harper Collins, Philips, Samsung, Bose, Sony, Tefal, Microsoft, Breville, Bosch, Garmin, Dyson, Remington, Case Logic, Creative, Braun, Sennheiser, Olympus, LG, Black & Decker, Acer and Walker Books.[6][7] Reception for the program has been mixed with some people criticizing the program's use of non-professional reviewers while others cited this as a benefit.[8][9] The Vine program operates independently on Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk,[10] Amazon.fr,[11] Amazon.de,[12] Amazon.ca[13] and Amazon.es.[14] (Wki)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Vine] 

## Purpose

Here we need to pick one of the datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, we have to use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, write a summary of the analysis to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
